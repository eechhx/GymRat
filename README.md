# GymRat
GymRat provides a fast and accurate personal training service through a simple and easy-to-use web app. Users can simply upload a photo, and the Posenet Tensorflow machine learning model will allow us to determine your pose in real-time. Feedback will then be provided on your form, and how you can improve your workouts.
